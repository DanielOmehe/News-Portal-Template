# News-Portal-Template
This is a news portal built with html css and some Javascript.
i haven't really done much on it yet so it might no look very impressive.
I built this using the NEWsAPI to fetch the news data. The newsApi has a few functionalities that help me to be able to tweak some stuff to create the functionality i need. The portal has a search input where you can search fro the latest news and also select a category.
To search for news you just type a keyword or phrase and the api feeds you with articles containing the specified keyword.
